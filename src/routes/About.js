            I am Andy Kim. I have done B.Tech with Computer and Moblie System as
            my major subject from AUT University. Recently, my passion lies in
            web application development including both the front end and the
            back end. I fell in love with modern JavaScript.

            challenges and get along with people very well. I believe in vision
            and action. I learn from my mistakes. I am ready to take any
            challenge required to perform my job.
